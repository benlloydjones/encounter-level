# Encouter level calculator

This is a small program that will provide the total xp for an encounter for D&D 5e.

It reads a JSON encounter table so the config can be changed without recompiling.

Alternatively it will use an encounter table built into the binary.

An example encounter table JSON is provided in this repo in the json directory.

The program operates a fairly standard cli and commands can be explore by running

`$ encounter-level --help`

against the compiled binary.
